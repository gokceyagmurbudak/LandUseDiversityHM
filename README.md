# LandUseDiversityHM

Urbanization is a defining feature of the contemporary world, with profound implications for both the
environment and society. As cities grow, knowing the geographical distribution of land use becomes more
important for successful urban planning and administration. Geospatial analytic approaches provide effective
tools for analyzing and describing urban settings. This project presents an analysis of urban land use diversity
utilizing geospatial methods, focusing on a specific study area and employing open-source libraries and raster
data.
The analysis uses several open-source Python libraries designed for geographical analysis, including OSMnx,
GeoPandas and Rasterio, among others. These libraries provide a comprehensive suite of functions for
acquiring, processing, and visualizing geospatial data, enabling a flexible and scalable approach to urban
analysis. The project's modular structure enables for seamless adaption to different study areas, facilitating
the exploration of urban land use dynamics across diverse geographical contexts.
